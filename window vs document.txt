 The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. 
 It is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the Document object model(DOM).

 What is a JavaScript document?
  A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.

 WINDOW
 Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model. 
 You can access it as window.
 Well, the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. 
 This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

 DOCUMENT
 What about the document object then?
  The Document object(DOM) is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser.
  The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
 What does this really mean?
   That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.
   property which is also available in short as document.property.
